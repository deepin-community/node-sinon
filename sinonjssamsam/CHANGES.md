- [`15295d9`](https://github.com/sinonjs/samsam/commit/15295d93358708dc61efe7348e43e968feb56723)
  Fix #237: Use jQuery#is() for jQuery equality (Morgan Roderick)
    >
    > In f1a1f306018166ad76ab1a1a71d400fc9373f7d0 we added support for
    > [Javascript iteraction protocols][0].
    >
    > jQuery objects happen to have iteration protocols, so they would trigger
    > the new codepath. However, that code path uses `Array.from` on the
    > input, which doesn't play nice with jQuery's serializer.
    >
    > Luckily, [jQuery has the `is()` method for comparing its objects][1].
    >
    > [0]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols

  Distribute package as source (Morgan Roderick)
    >
    > This library is not meant for writing end user applications or even for
    > being used directly when writing tests. It is not meant to be loaded

    > Consumers of this package are assumed to use their own bundlers, should
    > they need to bundle code for use in browsers or workers.
    >
    > Therefore, it is safe to distribute the package as source files and not
    > bundle them up.

    > This allows us to remove the bundler and its transitive dependencies,
    > which reduces the maintenance burden of managing the library.
